premise: 'Generate a story in a few paragraphs about when the US attempts to take
  over Canada and Greenland first through diplomatic and economic pressure and then
  direct military action.

  To defend themselves, the Canadians take use of the geography and urban layout of
  many North American cities close to bodies of water  and design spherical AI-enabled
  amphibious loitering ammunition robots named blue-amo the size of basketball.

  The robots are carried to American targets by small narco submarines provided by
  the Mexican cartels. These small autonomous submarines can swim in shallow waters
  undetected. They used to deliver Cocaine to US.

  At the target, the submarine opens a hatch and the robots roll off their container
  in the submarine and swim towards the shore. From there they roll into hiding places
  to act when and how their DeepSeek onboard Raspberry Pis determine appropriate.

  The robots find and connect to open WiFi connections and scan the news to determine
  where and when to attack. Their surface is covered in durable photocells, thus they
  charge their batteries by lying on the ground. They each carry a pound of high explosives.

  When in danger, the robots roll towards the closest body of water and hide under
  water.

  The robots recognize when manipulated by children or animals and avoid any harmful
  action.

  output: 'In a bold geopolitical move, the United States embarked on an ambitious
    plan to annex Canada and Greenland, initially employing diplomatic and economic
    pressures to bring these northern territories into its fold. The strained negotiations,
    however, quickly devolved into a tense standoff. As trade embargos and financial
    sanctions failed to sway the resilient Canadians and the resource-rich Greenlanders,
    the situation escalated, leading to a controversial military intervention. This
    aggressive posture spurred both defensive innovation and unexpected alliances
    across North America.


    Canada, known for its expansive and challenging terrain, quickly mobilized a defense
    strategy centered around cutting-edge technology and an intimate understanding
    of its geographic strengths. The Canadian Defense Forces, in collaboration with
    civilian tech companies, developed the Blue-Amo: spherical, AI-enabled amphibious
    loitering munitions. These robots, no larger than basketballs, were engineered
    to navigate effortlessly across diverse environments, from dense urban streets
    to sprawling water bodies.


    In a surprising turn of events, the Mexican cartels, leveraging their expertise
    in clandestine operations, partnered with Canadian forces to transport the Blue-Amo
    units across the border. Utilizing their fleet of small autonomous submarines,
    originally crafted for stealthily delivering narcotics, the cartels facilitated
    the discreet deployment of these innovative defense robots into strategic American
    locations. Upon reaching their destinations, the submarines would discreetly release
    their cargo, allowing the Blue-Amos to roll ashore undetected.


    Equipped with DeepSeek-enabled Raspberry Pis, these agile devices could connect
    to open WiFi networks to scan news and internet chatter for real-time situational
    awareness. Charging through their durable photocell exteriors, the Blue-Amos were
    self-sustaining, gathering solar energy as they lay camouflaged in urban environments.
    Their primary mission was simple yet formidable: identify key targets and assert
    strategic disruptions with the pound of high explosive they harbored within.


    The Blue-Amos'' algorithms were meticulously refined to minimize collateral damage.
    They possessed the unique ability to recognize potential threats to non-combatants,
    cleverly avoiding situations involving children or animals. In scenarios where
    danger seemed imminent, they demonstrated their amphibious agility, retreating
    to the closest water body to wait patiently beneath the surface until the threat
    subsided.


    This unprecedented defense strategy created a formidable deterrent against the
    escalating American offensive, demonstrating Canada''s resilience and ingenuity.
    As tensions simmered, the Blue-Amos exemplified a new era in autonomous warfare,
    one in which small, intelligent machines could decisively alter the course of
    conflicts across vast territories.'
