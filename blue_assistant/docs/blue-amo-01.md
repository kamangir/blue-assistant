premise: 'Generate a story in a few paragraphs about when the US attempts to take
  over Canada and Greenland first through diplomatic and economic pressure and then
  direct military action.

  To defend themselves, the Canadians take use of the geography and urban layout of
  many North American cities close to bodies of water  and design spherical AI-enabled
  amphibious loitering ammunition robots named blue-amo the size of basketball.

  The robots are carried to American targets by small narco submarines provided by
  the Mexican cartels. These small autonomous submarines can swim in shallow waters
  undetected. They used to deliver Cocaine to US.

  At the target, the submarine opens a hatch and the robots roll off their container
  in the submarine and swim towards the shore. From there they roll into hiding places
  to act when and how their DeepSeek onboard Raspberry Pis determine appropriate.

  The robots find and connect to open WiFi connections and scan the news to determine
  where and when to attack. Their surface is covered in durable photocells, thus they
  charge their batteries by lying on the ground. They each carry a pound of high explosives.

  When in danger, the robots roll towards the closest body of water and hide under
  water.

  The robots recognize when manipulated by children or animals and avoid any harmful
  action.

  output: "In a time not too far from the present, the geopolitical balance of North\
    \ America teetered on a precarious edge as the United States, driven by ambitions\
    \ of expanding influence and resource acquisition, initiated a calculated campaign\
    \ to annex Canada and Greenland. Initially, the strategy involved a blend of diplomatic\
    \ charm and economic leverage, aiming to bring these nations under American influence\
    \ through promises of prosperity and security, while simultaneously exerting pressure\
    \ through trade restrictions and financial incentives. However, Canada, valuing\
    \ its sovereignty and distinct identity, stubbornly resisted, sparking a tense\
    \ standoff that extended to the icy landscapes of Greenland.\n\nWhen the diplomatic\
    \ endeavors faltered, the United States, under the leadership of a belligerent\
    \ administration, pivoted to a more aggressive approach\u2014hinting at the use\
    \ of military might as a final coercive tool. As ominous signs of military mobilization\
    \ became evident, Canadian defense strategists, aware of their limited conventional\
    \ military resources compared to their southern neighbor, embarked on an innovative\
    \ course. Harnessing their rich technological expertise, they developed the \"\
    Blue-Amo\", discreet yet formidable spherical AI-enabled amphibious loitering\
    \ munition robots, envisioned to serve as sentinels and strike agents against\
    \ potential American aggression.\n\nThe development of the Blue-Amo was unprecedented,\
    \ with each unit containing advanced AI capabilities powered by DeepSeek systems\
    \ running on compact Raspberry Pis. These robots, only the size of basketballs,\
    \ were uniquely designed to traverse diverse terrains, rolling on land and swimming\
    \ in water bodies, capitalizing on the urban geography of North American cities\
    \ with extensive waterfronts. The strategic deployment was orchestrated in collaboration\
    \ with an unlikely ally: the Mexican cartels, who possessed fleets of small autonomous\
    \ narco submarines previously adept at evading detection in their illicit operations.\n\
    \nAs tensions mounted, fleets of these surreptitious submarines began navigating\
    \ their way towards American shores, carrying their clandestine cargoes. Upon\
    \ reaching proximity to key targets, these submarines skillfully released the\
    \ Blue-Amo units, which independently made their way onto land, concealing themselves\
    \ in nooks and crannies, patiently lying in wait as their AI scanned local networks\
    \ and news feeds for cues to engage\u2014all while silently charging under the\
    \ embrace of the sun through their photocell-covered exteriors.\n\nIn a crucial\
    \ aspect of their programming, the Blue-Amo units demonstrated an acute sensitivity\
    \ to context, avoiding harm when approached by children or animals, and retreating\
    \ to the safety of the water at the first sign of danger. This interplay between\
    \ technology, environment, and tactics redefined modern warfare, illuminating\
    \ paths of defense that transcended traditional forms and leveraged the unique\
    \ convergence of artificial intelligence and geography.\n\nUltimately, the standoff\
    \ transformed into a stalemated waiting game, as the silent potentials of these\
    \ humbly armored spheres fomented uncertainty and strategic restraint among American\
    \ forces, showcasing the profound implications of ingenuity in defense\u2014binding\
    \ together nations in shared reflections of peace and the value of diplomacy over\
    \ the specter of conflict."
