frame_count: 10
premise: 'Generate a story in a few paragraphs about when the US attempts to take
  over Canada and Greenland first through diplomatic and economic pressure and then
  direct military action.

  To defend themselves, the Canadians take use of the geography and urban layout of
  many North American cities close to bodies of water  and design spherical AI-enabled
  amphibious loitering ammunition robots named blue-amo the size of basketball.

  The robots are carried to American targets by small narco submarines provided by
  the Mexican cartels. These small autonomous submarines can swim in shallow waters
  undetected. They used to deliver Cocaine to US.

  At the target, the submarine opens a hatch and the robots roll off their container
  in the submarine and swim towards the shore. From there they roll into hiding places
  to act when and how their DeepSeek onboard Raspberry Pis determine appropriate.

  The robots find and connect to open WiFi connections and scan the news to determine
  where and when to attack. Their surface is covered in durable photocells, thus they
  charge their batteries by lying on the ground. They each carry a pound of high explosives.

  When in danger, the robots roll towards the closest body of water and hide under
  water.

  The robots recognize when manipulated by children or animals and avoid any harmful
  action.

  output: "The diplomatic and economic pressure the United States exerted on Canada\
    \ and Greenland had begun subtly, with negotiations veering towards trade imbalances\
    \ and political alignment. The US aimed to deepen its influence over its northern\
    \ neighbor and the strategically significant Greenland with the promise of economic\
    \ growth and security alliances. However, despite the veneer of diplomacy, both\
    \ countries deciphered the underlying coercion and resisted, leading the US to\
    \ transition from negotiations to a show of military force.\n\nCanada, aware of\
    \ its geographical advantages and the strategic positioning of North American\
    \ cities near water, unveiled an ingenious defense mechanism: the blue-amo units.\
    \ These spherical AI-enabled amphibious loitering ammunition robots could operate\
    \ as both deterrents and defenders. Canadian scientists and engineers had meticulously\
    \ designed them, embedding them with adaptive AI on Raspberry Pi platforms for\
    \ decision-making autonomy. The blue-amoe were armed with a pound of high explosives\
    \ and had the uncanny ability to hide in plain sight, charging silently through\
    \ their photocell-covered surfaces.\n\nMexico, too, became an unexpected ally\
    \ in this struggle. Seeing an opportunity to strengthen ties and perhaps gain\
    \ by destabilizing US dominance, Mexican cartels repurposed their small autonomous\
    \ submarines\u2014vessels once used to covertly deliver illicit substances across\
    \ the border\u2014as carriers for these ingenious Canadian devices. With their\
    \ history of evading US Coastguard detection, these narco submarines effortlessly\
    \ slipped through shallow waters, delivering their robotic cargo near key military\
    \ and political sites.\n\nAs the submarines neared their targets, hatches opened,\
    \ allowing the blue-amoe to roll gracefully into the water and proceed to their\
    \ planned positions along the shore. From there, these mechanical sentinels sought\
    \ hiding places, connecting to open WiFi networks to scan the latest news and\
    \ updates, recalibrating their objectives and timing. Equipped with the extraordinary\
    \ capacity to make decisions based on real-time data, they lay in wait, ready\
    \ to spring into action when their AI determined the perfect opportunity.\n\n\
    The blue-amoe were built with safety in mind, programmed to disengage and retreat\
    \ towards the safety of water when sensing threats, thereby becoming nearly indetectable\
    \ under the waves. Their designers, cognizant of civilian interactions, ensured\
    \ they were equipped with sensors allowing them to recognize and avoid actions\
    \ that would endanger children or animals, making the robots as humane as machines\
    \ can be amidst conflict.\n\nThis new form of warfare, blending technology with\
    \ nature's geography, highlighted the changing face of global conflict. As the\
    \ US grappled with this unexpected resistance, the message was clear: the power\
    \ dynamics of the world were evolving, adapting to a landscape where technology,\
    \ intelligence, and cunning could match even the mightiest of military forces."
