      output: 'As geopolitical tensions rose between the United States, Canada, and
        Greenland over the perceived need for resource control and national security,
        the U.S. initially sought to exert diplomatic and economic pressure to bring
        these northern territories under its influence. When diplomatic talks stalled
        and economic sanctions failed to yield the desired compliance, the situation
        escalated into direct military confrontation by the summer of 2028. Faced
        with a formidable adversary, the Canadian government was left with no choice
        but to deploy cutting-edge defense strategies, leveraging the unique North
        American geography and advanced technology to protect its sovereignty.


        Given its vast expanse and strategic urban layouts near major water bodies,
        Canada invested in the development of ingenious spherical AI-enabled devices
        called Blue-Amo. These amphibious loitering ammunition robots, no larger than
        basketballs, were designed to nimbly capitalize on both the terrains and the
        unexpected advantages of urban and aquatic environments. The defensive force,
        in a stroke of collaborative genius, struck an unlikely alliance with Mexican
        cartels known for their expertise in marine smuggling. The cartels provided
        fleets of small, autonomous narco submarines, once used to covertly deliver
        illicit substances from Mexico into the United States, to transport the Blue-Amos
        closer to strategic American targets. These nimble subs navigated undetected
        through shallow waters thanks to their stealth design and deep operational
        knowledge of the cartels.


        Upon reaching American shores, the submarines released their clandestine cargo.
        The Blue-Amos lay dormant onshore, cleverly scanning the surroundings before
        rolling into hidden crevices, their tiny yet powerful processors assessing
        the tactical environment via open WiFi networks. Adorned with durable photocells,
        the Blue-Amos absorbed sunlight to recharge their systems, patiently awaiting
        activation orders derived from real-time data analysis. With a payload of
        a pound of high explosives each, these sophisticated units became silent sentinels
        of Canadian resolve, forming an intelligent grid of defense that could mobilize
        at any hint of aggression.


        Central to their operating parameters was the ethical safeguard to deactivate
        or roll away when manipulated by children or animals, ensuring collateral
        safety. Furthermore, the Blue-Amos, when threatened by detection or intervention,
        had the capability to roll rapidly toward the nearest body of water, submerging
        themselves to lie in wait once more. As news reports flowed through the open
        networks, the Blue-Amos engaged their DeepSeek algorithms, dictating when
        to unleash their destructive potential with surgical precision, matching Canada''s
        objectives of deterrence over devastation.


        Through this audacious integration of technology, borderless collaboration,
        and geographical acumen, Canada introduced a new paradigm in asymmetric warfare,
        disrupting the conventional narrative of conquest and rewriting the rules
        of modern strategic defense. The Blue-Amos, floating silently in urban jungles
        and slipping through shadowy waters, stood as symbols of resilience in the
        face of overwhelming odds, redefining the league in which the smaller nation
        chose to compete and ultimately resist.'

    premise: 'Generate a story in a few paragraphs about when the US attempts to take
      over Canada and Greenland first through diplomatic and economic pressure and
      then direct military action.

      To defend themselves, the Canadians take use of the geography and urban layout
      of many North American cities close to bodies of water  and design spherical
      AI-enabled amphibious loitering ammunition robots named blue-amo the size of
      basketball.

      The robots are carried to American targets by small narco submarines provided
      by the Mexican cartels. These small autonomous submarines can swim in shallow
      waters undetected. They used to deliver Cocaine to US.

      At the target, the submarine opens a hatch and the robots roll off their container
      in the submarine and swim towards the shore. From there they roll into hiding
      places to act when and how their DeepSeek onboard Raspberry Pis determine appropriate.

      The robots find and connect to open WiFi connections and scan the news to determine
      where and when to attack. Their surface is covered in durable photocells, thus
      they charge their batteries by lying on the ground. They each carry a pound
      of high explosives.

      When in danger, the robots roll towards the closest body of water and hide under
      water.

      The robots recognize when manipulated by children or animals and avoid any harmful
      action.
