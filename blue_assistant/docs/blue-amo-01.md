premise: 'Generate a story in a few paragraphs about when the US attempts to take
  over Canada and Greenland first through diplomatic and economic pressure and then
  direct military action.

  To defend themselves, the Canadians take use of the geography and urban layout of
  many North American cities close to bodies of water  and design spherical AI-enabled
  amphibious loitering ammunition robots named blue-amo the size of basketball.

  The robots are carried to American targets by small narco submarines provided by
  the Mexican cartels. These small autonomous submarines can swim in shallow waters
  undetected. They used to deliver Cocaine to US.

  At the target, the submarine opens a hatch and the robots roll off their container
  in the submarine and swim towards the shore. From there they roll into hiding places
  to act when and how their DeepSeek onboard Raspberry Pis determine appropriate.

  The robots find and connect to open WiFi connections and scan the news to determine
  where and when to attack. Their surface is covered in durable photocells, thus they
  charge their batteries by lying on the ground. They each carry a pound of high explosives.

  When in danger, the robots roll towards the closest body of water and hide under
  water.

  The robots recognize when manipulated by children or animals and avoid any harmful
  action.

  output: 'In the tumultuous landscape of early 2025, the United States embarked on
    an audacious attempt to expand its influence over Canada and Greenland. Initially,
    the approach was subtle, enveloped in diplomacy and economic pressures. American
    leaders cloaked their intentions in grandiose promises of mutual advantage and
    regional stability. However, as Canada and Greenland resisted, the conflict escalated
    into overt aggressive action. The US military, confident of its technological
    superiority, mobilized along the border, preparing for a swift invasion. Unexpectedly,
    the Canadians had crafted an ingenious defense leveraging the unique geography,
    urban layouts, and advanced technology.


    Enter the blue-amo, a clandestine line of defense that turned the tide of this
    unconventional war. These spherical, AI-enabled amphibious robots, resembling
    oversized blue marbles, were the result of a secretive collaboration between Canadian
    defense engineers and civilian tech visionaries. Programmed with an advanced DeepSeek
    AI running on Raspberry Pi systems, these machines were designed to evade detection
    and strike with precision.


    To deliver the blue-amo robots into strategic US locations, Canadian tacticians
    forged an unlikely alliance with Mexican drug cartels, who had long operated a
    fleet of small, stealthy narco-submarines. These submarines, having mastered the
    art of clandestine navigation in shallow waters, now ferried military payloads
    instead of illicit narcotics. Quietly surfacing near American shores, the submarines
    released their robotic cargo, which adeptly navigated through water and then rolled
    onto dry land, seeking refuge and charging stations as they awaited instructions.


    Once ashore, the robots blended into their surroundings, utilizing open WiFi networks
    to scan local news and social media for intelligence reports and military activity.
    Charged by durable photocells and equipped with a pound of high explosives each,
    the blue-amo were poised to disrupt and neutralize high-value targets. Importantly,
    their AI was programmed with ethical constraints to prevent unwarranted casualties,
    rolling away harmlessly when approached by children or animals.


    As the US advanced, they found their efforts thwarted by an enigmatic force. Bridges
    were demolished, military convoys were incapacitated, and supply lines were severed
    - all seemingly at random. Efforts to locate and disable these elusive defenders
    proved futile as the blue-amo vanished into nearby waters at the first hint of
    danger.


    In this unexpected conflict, the natural geography of North America had become
    a formidable ally. With strategies born from resilience and innovation, Canada,
    buoyed by international support and the ingenuity of its people, managed to preserve
    its sovereignty. The US, facing mounting political pressure and embarrassment,
    was compelled to reconsider its approach, marking a turning point in the annals
    of North American relations and technology-driven warfare.'
