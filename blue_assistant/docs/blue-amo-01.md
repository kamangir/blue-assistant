premise: 'Generate a story in a few paragraphs about when the US attempts to take
  over Canada and Greenland first through diplomatic and economic pressure and then
  direct military action.

  To defend themselves, the Canadians take use of the geography and urban layout of
  many North American cities close to bodies of water  and design spherical AI-enabled
  amphibious loitering ammunition robots named blue-amo the size of basketball.

  The robots are carried to American targets by small narco submarines provided by
  the Mexican cartels. These small autonomous submarines can swim in shallow waters
  undetected. They used to deliver Cocaine to US.

  At the target, the submarine opens a hatch and the robots roll off their container
  in the submarine and swim towards the shore. From there they roll into hiding places
  to act when and how their DeepSeek onboard Raspberry Pis determine appropriate.

  The robots find and connect to open WiFi connections and scan the news to determine
  where and when to attack. Their surface is covered in durable photocells, thus they
  charge their batteries by lying on the ground. They each carry a pound of high explosives.

  When in danger, the robots roll towards the closest body of water and hide under
  water.

  The robots recognize when manipulated by children or animals and avoid any harmful
  action.

  output: "In the year 2032, tensions between the United States and its northern neighbor,\
    \ Canada, reached a breaking point. Driven by an ambition to exert greater influence\
    \ over the resource-rich regions of Canada and the strategic territory of Greenland,\
    \ the US initially deployed measures of diplomatic and economic pressure. Their\
    \ initial efforts, however, met with stiff resistance, as Canada rallied international\
    \ allies and leveraged global environmental treaties to stymie American advances.\n\
    \nRealizing that their tactics were floundering, the US government resorted to\
    \ a more aggressive stance, ultimately making the fateful decision to employ military\
    \ force. This move sent shockwaves across the globe, as an aggressive expansionist\
    \ policy was largely thought to be a relic of the past. But the Canadians were\
    \ ready. Anticipating such a scenario, they had secretly developed an innovative\
    \ defense strategy that capitalized on their natural resources and clandestine\
    \ alliances.\n\nThe Canadians launched a fleet of AI-enabled amphibious robots,\
    \ colloquially named \"Blue-Amo,\" designed to exploit the geography and urban\
    \ landscape of North American cities. These spherical robots, about the size of\
    \ basketballs, were stealthy and adaptable. Deployed through small narco submarines\
    \ provided by unlikely allies in the Mexican cartels\u2014who themselves had long\
    \ dealt in the trade routes to the US\u2014these robots were a marvel of engineering\
    \ and subterfuge.\n\nEach Blue-Amo was a masterpiece of autonomous operation,\
    \ powered by DeepSeek technology housed in Raspberry Pi units. Upon reaching their\
    \ destination, the Blue-Amo disembarked from the submarines, silently rolling\
    \ ashore to find suitable hiding places. Their mission was driven by sophisticated\
    \ AI algorithms capable of scanning open WiFi networks to stay informed via news\
    \ channels, determining the optimal moments and methods for their deployment.\n\
    \nThe subtlety of their operations was matched by their resilience; the robots\
    \ recharged using photocells embedded in their surfaces, lying quietly in the\
    \ open to soak up the sunlight. In times of potential capture, they would quicken\
    \ to the nearest waterway, submerging to evade detection. These robots, however,\
    \ were programmed to exhibit a level of discernment\u2014they recognized interference\
    \ by children or animals and were programmed to avoid causing harm in such interactions.\n\
    \nAs the United States military pressed forward, these inconspicuous allies became\
    \ a formidable deterrent, haunting urban centers with their latent presence. The\
    \ combination of unpredictable attacks and the moral restraint shown in avoiding\
    \ collateral damage captured the world's attention. This heightened level of warfare,\
    \ blending technology, geography, and covert alliances, set a new standard for\
    \ asymmetric defense, ultimately forcing a reconsideration of intentions and methods\
    \ from all parties involved. The silent sentinels of Canada\u2014the Blue-Amo\
    \ army\u2014demonstrated that in the evolving theater of warfare, a combination\
    \ of intellect, foresight, and collaboration could hold even the mightiest at\
    \ bay."

  output: '1. In the year 2032, diplomatic relations between the United States and
    Canada deteriorated over America''s ambition to control resource-rich regions
    and the strategic territory of Greenland. Diplomatic and economic pressure mounted,
    with Canada leveraging international alliances and treaties to resist.

    2. Frustrated by stagnation in their efforts, the US shifted to military action,
    preparing for an aggressive campaign to assert control. The move marked a stark
    departure from peaceful resolutions, raising global alarm and causing unrest in
    diplomatic circles.


    ---


    3. Anticipating this aggression, Canada revealed its secret innovation: AI-enabled
    amphibious robots named Blue-Amo, designed to exploit North American geographies
    and urban settings, poised for defense.


    ---


    4. Blue-Amo units, spherical and basketball-sized, were deployed covertly via
    small narco submarines supplied by Mexican cartels, who had a vested interest
    in maintaining their smuggling routes to the US.


    ---


    5. Upon reaching American shores, the Blue-Amo robots rolled silently onto land,
    scattered across potential target areas, and prepared to execute their mission
    with strategic precision.


    ---


    6. Each robot was powered by DeepSeek technology on Raspberry Pi units, using
    open WiFi networks to remain informed, constantly scanning the news to determine
    optimal moments for action.


    ---


    7. Built with sustainable operation in mind, the Blue-Amo charged via durable
    photocells, lying inconspicuously in the sun. Their self-sufficiency in power
    maintained their readiness without external support.


    ---


    8. When threatened, the robots swiftly retreated to nearby water bodies, submerging
    to evade detection and ensure longevity of their mission capability, demonstrating
    adaptability in evasion tactics.


    ---


    9. Remarkably, the Blue-Amo robots were designed with a moral compass; they were
    programmed to avoid causing harm if tampered with by children or animals, exhibiting
    a unique restraint in conflict environments.


    ---


    10. As US forces advanced, the persistent threat of Blue-Amo bolstered Canada''s
    defense, cultivating an era of warfare where technology and strategy intertwined
    to outmaneuver traditional military might.'
