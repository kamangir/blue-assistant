frame_count: 12
premise: 'Generate a story in a few paragraphs about when the US attempts to take
  over Canada and Greenland first through diplomatic and economic pressure and then
  direct military action.

  To defend themselves, the Canadians take use of the geography and urban layout of
  many North American cities close to bodies of water  and design spherical AI-enabled
  amphibious loitering ammunition robots named blue-amo the size of basketball.

  The robots are carried to American targets by small narco submarines provided by
  the Mexican cartels. These small autonomous submarines can swim in shallow waters
  undetected. They used to deliver Cocaine to US.

  At the target, the submarine opens a hatch and the robots roll off their container
  in the submarine and swim towards the shore. From there they roll into hiding places
  to act when and how their DeepSeek onboard Raspberry Pis determine appropriate.

  The robots find and connect to open WiFi connections and scan the news to determine
  where and when to attack. Their surface is covered in durable photocells, thus they
  charge their batteries by lying on the ground. They each carry a pound of high explosives.

  When in danger, the robots roll towards the closest body of water and hide under
  water.

  The robots recognize when manipulated by children or animals and avoid any harmful
  action.
