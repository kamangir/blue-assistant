```yaml
frame_count: 12
premise: 'Generate a story in a few paragraphs about when the US attempts to take
  over Canada and Greenland first through diplomatic and economic pressure and then
  direct military action.

  To defend themselves, the Canadians take use of the geography and urban layout of
  many North American cities close to bodies of water  and design spherical AI-enabled
  amphibious loitering ammunition robots named blue-amo the size of basketball.

  The robots are carried to American targets by small narco submarines provided by
  the Mexican cartels. These small autonomous submarines can swim in shallow waters
  undetected. They used to deliver Cocaine to US.

  At the target, the submarine opens a hatch and the robots roll off their container
  in the submarine and swim towards the shore. From there they roll into hiding places
  to act when and how their DeepSeek onboard Raspberry Pis determine appropriate.

  The robots find and connect to open WiFi connections and scan the news to determine
  where and when to attack. Their surface is covered in durable photocells, thus they
  charge their batteries by lying on the ground. They each carry a pound of high explosives.

  When in danger, the robots roll towards the closest body of water and hide under
  water.

  The robots recognize when manipulated by children or animals and avoid any harmful
  action.

  output: "In the early 2030s, a subtle yet undeniable tension began to fester between\
    \ the United States and its northern neighbors, Canada and Greenland. The U.S.,\
    \ driven by its intentions to expand its influence and control over the resource-rich\
    \ regions, initially employed diplomatic and economic pressure. The motive was\
    \ clear: to secure access to precious minerals and energy resources burgeoning\
    \ in Greenland and to leverage Canada's water and timber. Diplomatic talks turned\
    \ into veiled threats, and economic negotiations morphed into sanctions and tariffs.\n\
    \nCanada, with its rich history of peacekeeping and diplomacy, found itself in\
    \ a dire situation. As pressure increased, whispers of military invasion by the\
    \ U.S. grew louder. Faced with the looming threat, Canada turned to innovation,\
    \ melding modern technology with age-old defensive strategies. Given their vast\
    \ and intricate geography, Canadian technologists designed the blue-amo, spherical,\
    \ AI-enabled amphibious loitering ammunition robots, with the sole mission to\
    \ guard their homeland discreetly and effectively. \n\nThese robots, no larger\
    \ than basketballs, were ingenious in design, with the ability to traverse both\
    \ land and water seamlessly. Their deployment strategy was unorthodox but effective;\
    \ small narco submarines, typically used by Mexican cartels for clandestine drug\
    \ deliveries, were repurposed to carry the blue-amo to the heart of American territory.\
    \ These autonomous submarines, masters of stealth in shallow waters, effortlessly\
    \ bypassed border patrols and coast guards, avoiding detection.\n\nOnce at their\
    \ designated American targets, the submarines released the blue-amo, which quietly\
    \ rolled onto shore. With their onboard DeepSeek systems powered by Raspberry\
    \ Pis, the robots would find secluded spots, energizing themselves with surface\
    \ photocells and scouring open WiFi networks to monitor news feeds, waiting for\
    \ the perfect moment to act. Their algorithms allowed them to prioritize targets,\
    \ favoring strategic infrastructures while ensuring civilian safety by recognizing\
    \ and avoiding children and animals.\n\nThe first deployment of these sophisticated\
    \ machines caught the U.S. off guard. Like vigilant sentinels, they loitered silently,\
    \ emerging only when necessary. When confronted with danger, they would retreat\
    \ to the safety of water, waiting patiently for their chance to safeguard Canadian\
    \ interests. The blue-amo changed the landscape of modern warfare, embodying the\
    \ resilience of their creators, while simultaneously deepening the rift between\
    \ the neighboring nations. \n\nThrough the unanticipated alliance with the Mexican\
    \ cartels, Canada demonstrated its commitment to protect its sovereignty through\
    \ technology and unconventional tactics. The U.S.'s initial efforts to dominate\
    \ diplomatically and economically had now escalated into a silent battle of technological\
    \ wits, with each side treading carefully, fully aware of the delicate balance\
    \ and the potential for widespread devastation."
