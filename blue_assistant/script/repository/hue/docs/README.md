          \ application, or service, it's important to design it in a way that is\
          \ clear and user-friendly. Here are a few guidelines and examples for creating\
          \ an effective username prompt:\n\n### Guidelines\n\n1. **Clarity**: Make\
          \ it clear what the prompt is asking for. Use simple language that is easy\
          \ to understand.\n\n2. **Instructions**: Provide concise instructions or\
          \ criteria for what makes a valid username. This could include character\
          \ limits, allowed characters, or any restrictions.\n\n3. **Feedback**: Offer\
          \ real-time feedback as the user types, indicating whether the username\
          \ is available or if it meets the required criteria.\n\n4. **Example**:\
          \ Providing an example can help users understand what is expected.\n\n5.\
          \ **Accessibility**: Ensure the prompt is accessible to all users, including\
          \ those using assistive technologies.\n\n### Examples\n\n- **Simple Prompt**:\n\
          \  ```plaintext\n  Please enter your desired username:\n  ```\n\n- **Prompt\
          \ with Instructions**:\n  ```plaintext\n  Create a username (5-15 characters,\
          \ letters and numbers only):\n  ```\n\n- **Prompt with Example**:\n  ```plaintext\n\
          \  Choose a username (e.g., user123):\n  ```\n\n- **Prompt with Instant\
          \ Feedback**:\n  ```plaintext\n  Enter a username: [Input Box]\n  [Real-time\
          \ feedback: \"Username is available\" or \"Username must be 5-15 characters\
          \ and include only letters and numbers.\"]\n  ```\n\nImplementing these\
          \ elements can help ensure a smooth and intuitive experience for users creating\
          \ or entering their usernames. If you have a specific platform or system\
          \ in mind, let me know, and I can tailor the advice accordingly!"

        output: "When dealing with a \"light ID prompt,\" it's likely related to smart\
          \ home systems or applications where users need to identify or interact\
          \ with specific lighting devices. Unlike a simple username or password prompt,\
          \ a light ID prompt may involve additional considerations to ensure users\
          \ can easily identify and control the correct light.\n\nHere are some ideas\
          \ and best practices to implement a light ID prompt effectively:\n\n###\
          \ Guidelines for Light ID Prompt\n\n1. **Clear Identification**: Ensure\
          \ that each light has a unique and clearly identifiable name or ID. This\
          \ could be predefined or user-customizable.\n\n2. **Contextual Information**:\
          \ Provide contextual details such as the location or room where the light\
          \ is situated (e.g., \"Living Room Light 1\").\n\n3. **Visual Aid**: Where\
          \ possible, include a small icon or image that represents the light, helping\
          \ users associate the ID with the actual device.\n\n4. **Customization**:\
          \ Allow users to rename their lights for better personal identification,\
          \ such as changing \"Light ID 001\" to \"Kitchen Overhead.\"\n\n5. **Search\
          \ and Filter**: Implement a search feature that lets users easily find a\
          \ light by name or ID, especially useful in systems with many lights.\n\n\
          ### Examples\n\n- **Basic Prompt**:\n  ```plaintext\n  Please enter the\
          \ light ID:\n  ```\n\n- **Prompt with Context**:\n  ```plaintext\n  Enter\
          \ the ID of the light you wish to control (e.g., Living Room Light 1):\n\
          \  ```\n\n- **Prompt with List**:\n  ```plaintext\n  Select a light to control:\n\
          \  - Kitchen Light\n  - Hallway Light\n  - Bedroom Light\n  ```\n\n- **Searchable\
          \ Prompt**:\n  ```plaintext\n  Search for the light by name or ID:\n  [Search\
          \ Box]\n  ```\n\n- **Prompt with Visual and Customization**:\n  ```plaintext\n\
          \  Choose a light to adjust:\n  [ ] Kitchen Light - ID 002 [Image/Icon]\n\
          \  [ ] Bedroom Lamp - ID 003 [Image/Icon]\n  ```\n\nBy following these guidelines,\
          \ you can create a user-friendly and efficient system for users to control\
          \ and interact with their lighting devices easily. If you have a specific\
          \ platform or device in mind, feel free to provide more details so the advice\
          \ can be more tailored."

          \ {response.reason}\")\n            return False\n\n    except requests.RequestException\
          \ as e:\n        logger.error(f\"Request to Hue bridge failed: {e}\")\n\
          \        return False\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n\
          \    # Example call to the function\n    success = set_light_color(\n  \

          \        verbose=True\n    )\n```\n\n### Key points:\n- **Logging**: The\
          \ function logs the operations at different verbosity levels. If `verbose`\
          \ is `True`, the function logs more detailed information.\n- **HTTP Request**:\
          \ It uses the `requests` library to perform an HTTP PUT request to update\
          \ the light's settings on the Hue bridge.\n- **Error Handling**: The function\
          \ handles exceptions that may occur during the HTTP request process.\n-\
          \ **Bridge and Light IDs**: Ensure you have the correct bridge IP, username,\
          \ and light ID for your Hue setup before using this function.\n\nRemember\
          \ to install the `requests` library if it's not already available in your\
          \ environment by executing `pip install requests`. Additionally, replace\
          \ placeholders like IP address, username, and light ID with actual values\
          \ from your Philips Hue setup."
