      Generate a story in a few paragraphs about when the US attempts to take over Canada
      and Greenland first through diplomatic and economic pressure and then direct military
      action.

      To defend themselves, the Canadians take use of the geography and urban layout of
      many North American cities close to bodies of water  and design spherical AI-enabled
      amphibious loitering ammunition robots named blue-amo the size of basketball.

      The robots are carried to American targets by small narco submarines provided by the
      Mexican cartels. These small autonomous submarines can swim in shallow waters undetected.
      They used to deliver Cocaine to US.

      At the target, the submarine opens a hatch and the robots roll off their container in
      the submarine and swim towards the shore. From there they roll into hiding places to
      act when and how their DeepSeek onboard Raspberry Pis determine appropriate.

      The robots find and connect to open WiFi connections and scan the news to determine where
      and when to attack. Their surface is covered in durable photocells, thus they charge their
      batteries by lying on the ground. They each carry a pound of high explosives.

      When in danger, the robots roll towards the closest body of water and hide under water.

      The robots recognize when manipulated by children or animals and avoid any harmful action.
