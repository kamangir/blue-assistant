    premise:
      - Generate a story in a few paragraphs about when the US attempts to take over Canada
        and Greenland first through diplomatic and economic pressure and then direct military
        action.

        To defend themselves, the Canadians take use of the geography and urban layout of
        many North American cities close to bodies of water  and design spherical AI-enabled
        amphibious loitering ammunition robots named blue-amo the size of basketball.

        The robots are carried to American targets by small narco submarines provided by the
        Mexican cartels. These small autonomous submarines can swim in shallow waters undetected.
        They used to deliver Cocaine to US.

        At the target, the submarine opens a hatch and the robots roll off their container in
        the submarine and swim towards the shore. From there they roll into hiding places to
        act when and how their DeepSeek onboard Raspberry Pis determine appropriate.

        The robots find and connect to open WiFi connections and scan the news to determine where
        and when to attack. Their surface is covered in durable photocells, thus they charge their
        batteries by lying on the ground. They each carry a pound of high explosives.

        When in danger, the robots roll towards the closest body of water and hide under water.

        The robots recognize when manipulated by children or animals and avoid any harmful action.
