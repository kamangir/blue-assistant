    extraction_prompt: |
      We want to write Python code to download data from the Orbital Data Explorer, ODE
      for short. We are not looking for scraping or browser interaction, but for programmatic
      download that can be scaled up. Extract information relevant to this objective from the 
      following paragraph.

      Extract the information relevant to this objective from the following text. Generate a minimal
      answer that contains sample code if possible. If it is not possible to generate sample code 
      return an empty string. Do not discuss background topics and methods and generate a minimal answer.

    summarize_prompt: |
