      STAC-like-representation: >
        We want to use the following generalized STAC definitions to develop query and access mechanisms to 
        Orbital Data Explorer, ODE for short:

        We consider ODE as a catalog, similar to a STAC catalog.
        We define the datasets within ODE, if they exist, as separate collections, similar to STAC collections.
        We define the semi-atomic unit of data in ODE as a datacube, similar to a STAC item.

        Collect any information in this page that is relevant to the above definitions.
