        Mars Orbital Data Explorer Access This project aims to provide an easy-to-use
        interface to access data from the Mars Orbital Data Explorer (ODE) , maintained
        by the Geosciences Node of NASA''s Planetary Data System (PDS), via the ODE
        REST Service Since the data return by the ODE usually consists of high-resolution
        map-projected JP2 images, utility methods have also been provided to slice
        each image into equal-size chunks with all black-margins cropped out so that
        they can be processed by appropriate machine learning models. _____ ________

        setup.py VERSION Basic Usage Run main.py to generate a sample query and fetch
        sample results: python main.py The entire process consists of 3 steps: 1.
        Initialize Query Processor Initialize an instance of the QueryProcessor class
        to process user-defined query parameters, details of which are given in the
        upcoming sections: query_processor = QueryProcessor()query_results = query_processor.query_files_urls(target,
        mission, instrument, product_type, western_lon, eastern_lon, min_lat, max_lat,
        min_ob_time, max_ob_time, product_id, file_name, number_product_limit, result_offset_number)
        Supported Query Parameters The list of supported query parameters is as shown
        below: Parameter Description target Aimed planetary body, i.e., Mars, Mercury,
        Moon, Phobos, or Venus mission Aimed mission, e.g., MGS or MRO instrument
        Aimed instrument from the mission, e.g., HIRISE or CRISM product_type Type
        of product to look for, e.g., DTM or RDRV11 western_lon Western longitude
        to look for the data, from 0 to 360 eastern_lon Eastern longitude to look
        for the data, from 0 to 360 min_lat Minimal latitude to look for the data,
        from -90 to 90 max_lat Maximal latitude to look for the data, from -90 to
        90 product_id PDS Product Id to look for, with wildcards (*) allowed min_ob_time
        Minimal observation time in (even partial) UTC format, e.g., ''2017-03-01''
        max_ob_time Maximal observation time in (even partial) UTC format, e.g., ''2017-03-01''
        file_name File name to look for, with wildcards (*) allowed number_product_limit
        Maximal number of products to return (100 at most) result_offset_number Offset
        the return products, to go beyond the limit of 100 returned products remove_ndv
        Replace the no-data value as mentionned in the label by np.nan 2. Initialize
        Query Result Processor Initialize an instance of the QueryResultProcessor
        class to process the results returned by your QueryProcessor instance. In
        this step, you will have to specify user-defined parameters for the chunks
        and bin type (if applicable): query_result_processor = QueryResultProcessor()should_continue
        = query_result_processor.download(query_results, bin_type, product_types)##
        Add the following lines only if you wish to chunkify all downloaded imagesif
        should_continue: query_result_processor.process(SAVE_DIR_PREFIX, CHUNK_SIZE,
        SKIP_BLACK_IMAGES, ALIGN_AND_CROP_THRESHOLDS, None) Supported Query Result
        Parameters The list of supported query result parameters is as shown below:
        Parameter Description bin_type Type of binning used in image - Bin1 = 0.35
        cm/pixel, Bin2 = 2xBin1, Bin4 = 2xBin2 product_types Set of product types
        to which any downloaded product should belong. Eg., PRODUCT DATA FILE, BROWSE,
        GREYSCALE THUMBNAIL Chunk Parameters The following parameters can be used
        to control how chunks are processed: Parameter Description save_dir_prefix
        Prefix to be used in the name of the directory where the chunks of an image
        will be saved. For eg., chunks of an image "ESP_123_456.JP2" will be saved
        in a directory named "save_dir_prefix_ESP_123_456" chunk_size Size of each
        chunk that will be sliced from a high-resolution image. Eg., 1024 vectorized_chunks
        List in which all chunks of all JP2 images will be aggregated. If not required,
        just assign None skip_black_images Flag to indicate that all images containing
        black pixels near the center should be skipped Chunk Alignment and Cropping
        Thresholds The following parameters can be used to control how a chunk containing
        black margins, is aligned, cropped and/or rotated: Parameter Description max_border_size
        Border to be checked around the image while aligning and cropping black margins
        safety_margin Removes extra pixels from the sides to make sure no black remains
        while aligning and cropping black margins tolerance A gray value is more likely
        to be considered black when you increase the tolerance 3. Vectorized Chunks
        (Optional) If you wish to accumulate all chunks of all images into a python
        list, then initialize an empty list before step 1, and each time you call
        the QueryResultProcessor for multiple queries, pass this list as the vectorized_chunks
        parameter: query_result_processor.process(SAVE_DIR_PREFIX, CHUNK_SIZE, SKIP_BLACK_IMAGES,
        ALIGN_AND_CROP_THRESHOLDS, vectorized_chunks) Acknowledgements scikit-dataaccess

        \ Search**: Allows you to search for orbital science products across different\
        \ missions, instruments, and data sets using criteria such as time, location,\
        \ and product IDs. This aligns with the STAC concept of searching for items\
        \ using specific properties and metadata.\n   - **Data Set Browser**: Enables\
        \ browsing through the available orbital data set files stored in the PDS\
        \ archives.\n   - **Download Cart**: Users can add products to a download\
        \ cart from the product search results and then download them. \n\n3. **Additional\
        \ Tools**:\n   - Additional tools like LOLA RDR Query and DIVINER RDR Query\
        \ for specific products.\n\n4. **Help and Resources**:\n   - Access to help\
        \ and resources for understanding and using the ODE, including potential future\
        \ updates.\n\n5. **Account Management**:\n   - Users have options to sign\
        \ in or create a free account, though it's unclear from the text whether downloading\
        \ data requires an account.\n\nFor implementing the code to interact with\
        \ ODE using Python, you might want to consider using libraries for HTTP requests\
        \ (such as `requests`) and possibly handling STAC metadata if a specific API\
        \ endpoint or metadata format is provided.\n\nHere is a potential approach\
        \ for writing code to interact with ODE:\n\n- **HTTP Requests**: Use the `requests`\
        \ library to interact with the ODE API (assuming an appropriate API endpoint\
        \ is provided by ODE documentation).\n- **Search and Filter**: Utilize search\
        \ parameters compatible with STAC, focusing on fields like missions, instruments,\
        \ and product types.\n- **Download**: Implement functionality to add items\
        \ to a download cart and retrieve them, if applicable.\n- **Error Handling**:\
        \ Ensure the code manages potential issues like connectivity or invalid search\
        \ parameters.\n\nTo proceed, you'll need to refer to any documentation provided\
        \ by ODE or the PDS Geosciences Node to understand specific API endpoints,\
        \ parameters, and response formats that align with STAC terminology."

      output: 'To write Python code to download data from the Mercury Orbital Data
        Explorer (ODE) using STAC terminology, you need to extract the relevant information
        about how to search and download data. Based on the provided text, here are
        the key points that can help inform your code:


        1. **Data Access**: The ODE allows you to search for orbital science products
        across missions, instruments, and data sets using parameters like time, location,
        and product IDs. This means the API or search functionality might support
        querying using these parameters.


        2. **Data Download**: Products can be added to a "Download Cart" from the
        product search, suggesting that after identifying desired data, it can be
        programmatically added to a cart-like structure before initiating downloads.


        3. **JavaScript and Browser Requirements**: It mentions that JavaScript and
        browser frames need to be enabled for the ODE website to function properly.
        While this doesn''t directly affect a Python script, it implies that some
        advanced interaction or web scraping might require enabling these features
        if using a tool like Selenium for automated browsing.


        4. **Documentation and Help**: There are Help & Resources sections available,
        which might contain API documentation or further details on accessing and
        downloading data programmatically.


        5. **Contact Information**: For questions or further assistance, you can contact
        the support team via email at ode@wunder.wustl.edu. This can be useful if
        you encounter issues not covered in the available documentation.


        With these points in mind, you''ll need to investigate further to find specific
        API documentation or endpoints that allow for programmatic access, search,
        and download of data. Normally, this would be in the resources section, or
        by contacting support for API documentation.'

        Asset Catalog) terminology, you would focus on the specific functions and
        capabilities of ODE related to searching and accessing data. From the provided
        text, here are the relevant points for achieving this objective:


        1. **Account Creation and Login**: To access certain features of ODE, such
        as tracking search history and bookmarking items, you need to create and log
        into a user account. This account is used across all versions of ODE (Mars,
        Mercury, Lunar, and Venus).


        2. **Product Search**: Use the product search feature of ODE to find specific
        items or datasets. This might include searching for specific PDS, ESA, and
        JAXA products.


        3. **Map Search**: Utilize the map search feature to find spatial data. This
        would be particularly relevant for accessing data in a manner consistent with
        STAC''s geospatial focus.


        4. **Product Detail Page**: Once a product is located, the product detail
        page will offer more information and potential download options.


        5. **Bookmarks and Cart**: Once logged in, users can bookmark searches or
        individual observations and review or manage these items through a cart system.


        To implement these into your Python code:


        - **Authentication**: Handle user account sessions for login functionality
        if required for specific data access.

        - **Data Search**: Implement functions to interface with ODE''s search API,
        if available, corresponding with product and map searches.

        - **Data Access and Download**: Once desired data products are identified,
        download them using their URLs or any provided API. Use bookmarks or cart
        orders if needed to keep track of multiple products.


        Additionally, consider whether the ODE has an API you can interact with using
        a library like `requests` in Python for querying and downloading data. This
        would require checking ODE''s current documentation or contacting them directly
        via their provided email for detailed technical guidance.'

        Analyst''s Notebook Website , for user convenience. The same user account
        is used for all versions of ODE. The user account allows ODEusers to track
        their search history, bookmark searches and individual observations (PDS,
        ESA, and JAXAproducts), and review cart history. Users need to log into each
        version of ODE (Mars, Mercury, Lunar, and Venus) to view their histories,
        bookmarks, and cart history for that version of ODE. See the following help
        links for details on various account features. Account maintance Creating

      output: "To write Python code to download data from the Orbital Data Explorer\
        \ (ODE) using STAC terminology, you need to extract the key aspects related\
        \ to STAC (SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog). While the provided text focuses\
        \ on account creation for the ODE, it mentions several actions relevant to\
        \ accessing data:\n\n1. **Creating an Account**: \n   - Navigate to the ODE\
        \ website.\n   - Click on the login icon, and select \"Create an account.\"\
        \n   - Enter your email, password, and CAPTCHA text to create the account.\n\
        \n2. **Post-Account Features**:\n   - Once logged in, you can access additional\
        \ features such as bookmarking product detail pages and search result lists.\n\
        \nWhile this text doesn't specifically discuss STAC terminology, understanding\
        \ user account creation at ODE is crucial as data access can often be gated\
        \ by authentication. To download data programmatically from ODE using Python,\
        \ you will generally need:\n\n- Authorization headers for API requests which\
        \ involves using the email and password from the account creation process.\n\
        - Implementation of STAC API endpoints to search and download datasets, utilizing\
        \ STAC terminology such as Collections, Items, and Assets. \n\nMake sure to\
        \ consult the ODE API documentation to see if it supports STAC directly or\
        \ if you'll need to interface with a custom ODE API to perform STAC-like queries\
        \ and data retrieval."

        All Files Submit Search Creating An Account Creating an account is quick and
        simple! At the top of the ODE banner, an icon exists that shows that the user
        is not logged in. Clicking on that icon will confirm you are an anonymous
        user and provide options for sign in, creating an account or this help. Here
        is the menu displayed to anonymous users: Click on the "Create an account"
        link, which directs the browser to a page for creating the account. Enter
        your preferred email address, password, and the displayed "CAPTCHA" text.
        If it is not legible, click the refresh button to the right of the captcha.
        Sometimes the "CAPTCHA" text can be difficult to read. After populating these
        fields, click the "Create account" button. Upon successful creation of the
        account, a confirmation message will be displayed and a corresponding email
        will be sent. That''s it! Now upon navigating to other pages of the website,
        you will see the logged in menu is populated. In addition, the option to bookmark
        product detail pages and search result lists will be provided.
