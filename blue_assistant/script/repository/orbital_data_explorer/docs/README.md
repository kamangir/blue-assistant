        We want to access Orbital Data Explorer, ODE for short, using STAC conventions. So, we consider ODE as a catalog and 
        call each separate dataset in ODE as a collection. Read the following text and write a python function that generates 
        the list of collections in ODE relevant to Mars, Moon, Venus, or Mercury.

        Then, write a python function that finds an item in one of the listed datasets. :::input
