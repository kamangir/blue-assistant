      Our objective is to access the Orbital Data Explorer, ODE for short, using STAC 
      terminology. For this purpose, we consider ODE as a catalog and each separate dataset 
      in ODE as a collection that contains items. We call these items objects or datacubes.

        using SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog (STAC) terminology, it''s important to
        understand the mapping between STAC concepts and the structure of ODE:


        1. **Catalog**: In STAC terminology, a catalog is the entry point that organizes
        datasets and provides metadata about them. In this context, the entire ODE
        is treated as a catalog.


        2. **Collection**: A collection in STAC is a group of related data items.
        Each separate dataset within ODE can be considered as a collection. These
        collections contain metadata that describes the dataset, including its spatial
        and temporal extent, data provider, and other relevant information.


        3. **Items**: Items are the individual records or data points within a collection.
        In the context of ODE, these are referred to as objects or datacubes. Each
        item contains metadata about the specific data object, including its properties,
        assets (e.g., data files), and geospatial and temporal information.


        By mapping ODE''s structure to STAC terminology, you can use standardized
        methods and tools designed for STAC to explore and access the datasets within
        ODE. This entails viewing the ODE as a catalog, with each dataset represented
        as a collection, and each data point within those datasets represented as
        an item (objects or datacubes).'

        using STAC terminology, you need to understand the structure as outlined in
        your description:


        1. **Catalog**: ODE acts as a catalog, which is the top-level entry point
        in the STAC hierarchy. As a catalog, it organizes various datasets and collections.


        2. **Collections**: Each dataset within ODE is considered a collection. In
        STAC, a collection is a grouping of related data items, usually around a theme
        or topic. For ODE, this might mean different types of satellite data or data
        from different missions.


        3. **Items**: Within each collection, there are items. These items are referred
        to as objects or datacubes in your context. In STAC, items are the individual
        pieces of data that users can query.


        To proceed with your objective of accessing ODE using STAC, you should:


        - Identify the specific datasets in ODE that you want to treat as collections.

        - Understand the structure and metadata associated with each collection to
        effectively utilize STAC''s querying capabilities.

        - Develop or utilize existing tools that can communicate using STAC APIs to
        find and access the specific items or datacubes you need from the collections
        in ODE.'

        using STAC terminology, you can map the elements of ODE to the structure provided
        by the STAC specification as follows:


        1. **Catalog**: In the STAC model, a catalog is a container for storing metadata
        about datasets (collections) and their associated items. In your case, the
        entire ODE serves as this catalog.


        2. **Collections**: Each separate dataset within the ODE is considered a collection.
        A collection contains metadata about the dataset itself and can include one
        or more items.


        3. **Items**: Within each collection, there are individual elements known
        as items. In your framework, these items are referred to as objects or datacubes.
        Each item represents a specific piece of data or a discreet data unit within
        the dataset.


        Mapping ODE to STAC terminology allows you to structure the ODE data in a
        way that aligns with the STAC specification, facilitating easier access, discovery,
        and interoperability of geospatial data. By treating ODE as a STAC catalog
