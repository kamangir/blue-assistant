        Mars Orbital Data Explorer Access This project aims to provide an easy-to-use
        interface to access data from the Mars Orbital Data Explorer (ODE) , maintained
        by the Geosciences Node of NASA''s Planetary Data System (PDS), via the ODE
        REST Service Since the data return by the ODE usually consists of high-resolution
        map-projected JP2 images, utility methods have also been provided to slice
        each image into equal-size chunks with all black-margins cropped out so that
        they can be processed by appropriate machine learning models. _____ ________

        setup.py VERSION Basic Usage Run main.py to generate a sample query and fetch
        sample results: python main.py The entire process consists of 3 steps: 1.
        Initialize Query Processor Initialize an instance of the QueryProcessor class
        to process user-defined query parameters, details of which are given in the
        upcoming sections: query_processor = QueryProcessor()query_results = query_processor.query_files_urls(target,
        mission, instrument, product_type, western_lon, eastern_lon, min_lat, max_lat,
        min_ob_time, max_ob_time, product_id, file_name, number_product_limit, result_offset_number)
        Supported Query Parameters The list of supported query parameters is as shown
        below: Parameter Description target Aimed planetary body, i.e., Mars, Mercury,
        Moon, Phobos, or Venus mission Aimed mission, e.g., MGS or MRO instrument
        Aimed instrument from the mission, e.g., HIRISE or CRISM product_type Type
        of product to look for, e.g., DTM or RDRV11 western_lon Western longitude
        to look for the data, from 0 to 360 eastern_lon Eastern longitude to look
        for the data, from 0 to 360 min_lat Minimal latitude to look for the data,
        from -90 to 90 max_lat Maximal latitude to look for the data, from -90 to
        90 product_id PDS Product Id to look for, with wildcards (*) allowed min_ob_time
        Minimal observation time in (even partial) UTC format, e.g., ''2017-03-01''
        max_ob_time Maximal observation time in (even partial) UTC format, e.g., ''2017-03-01''
        file_name File name to look for, with wildcards (*) allowed number_product_limit
        Maximal number of products to return (100 at most) result_offset_number Offset
        the return products, to go beyond the limit of 100 returned products remove_ndv
        Replace the no-data value as mentionned in the label by np.nan 2. Initialize
        Query Result Processor Initialize an instance of the QueryResultProcessor
        class to process the results returned by your QueryProcessor instance. In
        this step, you will have to specify user-defined parameters for the chunks
        and bin type (if applicable): query_result_processor = QueryResultProcessor()should_continue
        = query_result_processor.download(query_results, bin_type, product_types)##
        Add the following lines only if you wish to chunkify all downloaded imagesif
        should_continue: query_result_processor.process(SAVE_DIR_PREFIX, CHUNK_SIZE,
        SKIP_BLACK_IMAGES, ALIGN_AND_CROP_THRESHOLDS, None) Supported Query Result
        Parameters The list of supported query result parameters is as shown below:
        Parameter Description bin_type Type of binning used in image - Bin1 = 0.35
        cm/pixel, Bin2 = 2xBin1, Bin4 = 2xBin2 product_types Set of product types
        to which any downloaded product should belong. Eg., PRODUCT DATA FILE, BROWSE,
        GREYSCALE THUMBNAIL Chunk Parameters The following parameters can be used
        to control how chunks are processed: Parameter Description save_dir_prefix
        Prefix to be used in the name of the directory where the chunks of an image
        will be saved. For eg., chunks of an image "ESP_123_456.JP2" will be saved
        in a directory named "save_dir_prefix_ESP_123_456" chunk_size Size of each
        chunk that will be sliced from a high-resolution image. Eg., 1024 vectorized_chunks
        List in which all chunks of all JP2 images will be aggregated. If not required,
        just assign None skip_black_images Flag to indicate that all images containing
        black pixels near the center should be skipped Chunk Alignment and Cropping
        Thresholds The following parameters can be used to control how a chunk containing
        black margins, is aligned, cropped and/or rotated: Parameter Description max_border_size
        Border to be checked around the image while aligning and cropping black margins
        safety_margin Removes extra pixels from the sides to make sure no black remains
        while aligning and cropping black margins tolerance A gray value is more likely
        to be considered black when you increase the tolerance 3. Vectorized Chunks
        (Optional) If you wish to accumulate all chunks of all images into a python
        list, then initialize an empty list before step 1, and each time you call
        the QueryResultProcessor for multiple queries, pass this list as the vectorized_chunks
        parameter: query_result_processor.process(SAVE_DIR_PREFIX, CHUNK_SIZE, SKIP_BLACK_IMAGES,
        ALIGN_AND_CROP_THRESHOLDS, vectorized_chunks) Acknowledgements scikit-dataaccess

        Orbiter (LO) spacecraft . Venus ODE includes data from the Magellan and MESSENGER
        spacecraft. ODE is designed to augment the existing PDS search and retrieval
        interface by providing advanced search, retrieve, and order tools, integrated
        analysis tools, and visualization tools. ODE provides a way to store, query,
        retrieve, and order PDS archive data at the product level. In general, ODE
        has a back-end process that loads PDS archive data from local and remote nodes
        into a central database. This database is then used to allow the user to find,
        review, and download specific products. ODE does not change PDS archives nor,
        in most cases, stores the actual product contents. Rather it is a tool for
        finding, exploring, selecting, and downloading these products.
