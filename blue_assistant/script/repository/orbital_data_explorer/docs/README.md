      Our objective is to access the Orbital Data Explorer, ODE for short, using STAC 
      terminology. For this purpose, we consider ODE as a catalog and each separate dataset 
      in ODE as a collection that contains items. We call these items objects or datacubes.

        1. **ODE as a Catalog**: Consider the entire ODE platform as a catalog.


        2. **Collections**: Treat each separate dataset in the ODE as a collection.
        These collections contain individual items.


        3. **Items**: Refer to the individual items within each collection as objects
        or datacubes.


        There are no specific steps in the provided text regarding interacting with
        ODE using STAC terminology. However, the text provides instructions for signing
        into the ODE:


        - Click the user icon to access the sign-in menu.

        - Click "Sign in" and fill in your email address and password.

        - Click the "Sign in" button.

        - In case of a forgotten password, a "Forgot password" option is available,
        which will send a password reset link to your email.


        This information is essential for gaining access to the ODE platform, where
        STAC terminology can then be applied to interact with datasets.'

        mission.


        3. **Items (Objects or Datacubes)**: Within each collection, the specific

        data files and datacubes that are part of the datasets within ODE.


        4. **Data Product Search**: Utilize the Data Product Search to locate specific
        orbital science products using parameters such as missions, instruments, data
        sets, time, location, and product IDs.


        5. **Data Set Browser**: Use the Data Set Browser to navigate through the
        available orbital data set files stored in the Planetary Data System (PDS)
        archives.


        6. **Download Cart**: Items or data products can be added to a download cart,
        from which they can be downloaded after search.
