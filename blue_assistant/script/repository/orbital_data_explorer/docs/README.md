        \ within the ODE is considered a separate collection.\n\n3. **Items**: Within\
        \ these collections, individual data items, such as high-resolution map-projected\
        \ JP2 images, can be accessed and processed.\n\n4. **Python Package**: \n\
        \   - The package is named `mars-ode-data-access` and is hosted on GitHub\
        \ under the repository `samiriff/mars-ode-data-access`.\n   - It aims to provide\
        \ an easy-to-use interface for accessing data from the ODE.\n\n5. **REST API\
        \ Interaction**: \n   - The interaction with ODE data is performed using the\
        \ ODE REST Service, where users can define queries to access specific datasets.\n\
        \n6. **Query Processing**:\n   - The `QueryProcessor` class is used to construct\
        \ and process user-defined queries for accessing ODE data.\n   - Supported\
        \ query parameters include target planetary body, mission, instrument, product\
        \ type, geographic coordinates, observation time, and more.\n\n7. **Result\
        \ Processing**:\n   - The `QueryResultProcessor` class processes results returned\
        \ by queries.\n   - It supports downloading data, chunking large images, and\
        \ handling image binning.\n\n8. **Image Processing Utilities**:\n   - Includes\
        \ utility methods for processing images, such as cropping black margins, slicing\
        \ images into chunks, and aligning/rotating images.\n\n9. **Sample Code Usage**:\n\

        Mars Orbital Data Explorer Access This project aims to provide an easy-to-use
        interface to access data from the Mars Orbital Data Explorer (ODE) , maintained
        by the Geosciences Node of NASA''s Planetary Data System (PDS), via the ODE
        REST Service Since the data return by the ODE usually consists of high-resolution
        map-projected JP2 images, utility methods have also been provided to slice
        each image into equal-size chunks with all black-margins cropped out so that
        they can be processed by appropriate machine learning models. _____ ________

        setup.py VERSION Basic Usage Run main.py to generate a sample query and fetch
        sample results: python main.py The entire process consists of 3 steps: 1.
        Initialize Query Processor Initialize an instance of the QueryProcessor class
        to process user-defined query parameters, details of which are given in the
        upcoming sections: query_processor = QueryProcessor()query_results = query_processor.query_files_urls(target,
        mission, instrument, product_type, western_lon, eastern_lon, min_lat, max_lat,
        min_ob_time, max_ob_time, product_id, file_name, number_product_limit, result_offset_number)
        Supported Query Parameters The list of supported query parameters is as shown
        below: Parameter Description target Aimed planetary body, i.e., Mars, Mercury,
        Moon, Phobos, or Venus mission Aimed mission, e.g., MGS or MRO instrument
        Aimed instrument from the mission, e.g., HIRISE or CRISM product_type Type
        of product to look for, e.g., DTM or RDRV11 western_lon Western longitude
        to look for the data, from 0 to 360 eastern_lon Eastern longitude to look
        for the data, from 0 to 360 min_lat Minimal latitude to look for the data,
        from -90 to 90 max_lat Maximal latitude to look for the data, from -90 to
        90 product_id PDS Product Id to look for, with wildcards (*) allowed min_ob_time
        Minimal observation time in (even partial) UTC format, e.g., ''2017-03-01''
        max_ob_time Maximal observation time in (even partial) UTC format, e.g., ''2017-03-01''
        file_name File name to look for, with wildcards (*) allowed number_product_limit
        Maximal number of products to return (100 at most) result_offset_number Offset
        the return products, to go beyond the limit of 100 returned products remove_ndv
        Replace the no-data value as mentionned in the label by np.nan 2. Initialize
        Query Result Processor Initialize an instance of the QueryResultProcessor
        class to process the results returned by your QueryProcessor instance. In
        this step, you will have to specify user-defined parameters for the chunks
        and bin type (if applicable): query_result_processor = QueryResultProcessor()should_continue
        = query_result_processor.download(query_results, bin_type, product_types)##
        Add the following lines only if you wish to chunkify all downloaded imagesif
        should_continue: query_result_processor.process(SAVE_DIR_PREFIX, CHUNK_SIZE,
        SKIP_BLACK_IMAGES, ALIGN_AND_CROP_THRESHOLDS, None) Supported Query Result
        Parameters The list of supported query result parameters is as shown below:
        Parameter Description bin_type Type of binning used in image - Bin1 = 0.35
        cm/pixel, Bin2 = 2xBin1, Bin4 = 2xBin2 product_types Set of product types
        to which any downloaded product should belong. Eg., PRODUCT DATA FILE, BROWSE,
        GREYSCALE THUMBNAIL Chunk Parameters The following parameters can be used
        to control how chunks are processed: Parameter Description save_dir_prefix
        Prefix to be used in the name of the directory where the chunks of an image
        will be saved. For eg., chunks of an image "ESP_123_456.JP2" will be saved
        in a directory named "save_dir_prefix_ESP_123_456" chunk_size Size of each
        chunk that will be sliced from a high-resolution image. Eg., 1024 vectorized_chunks
        List in which all chunks of all JP2 images will be aggregated. If not required,
        just assign None skip_black_images Flag to indicate that all images containing
        black pixels near the center should be skipped Chunk Alignment and Cropping
        Thresholds The following parameters can be used to control how a chunk containing
        black margins, is aligned, cropped and/or rotated: Parameter Description max_border_size
        Border to be checked around the image while aligning and cropping black margins
        safety_margin Removes extra pixels from the sides to make sure no black remains
        while aligning and cropping black margins tolerance A gray value is more likely
        to be considered black when you increase the tolerance 3. Vectorized Chunks
        (Optional) If you wish to accumulate all chunks of all images into a python
        list, then initialize an empty list before step 1, and each time you call
        the QueryResultProcessor for multiple queries, pass this list as the vectorized_chunks
        parameter: query_result_processor.process(SAVE_DIR_PREFIX, CHUNK_SIZE, SKIP_BLACK_IMAGES,
        ALIGN_AND_CROP_THRESHOLDS, vectorized_chunks) Acknowledgements scikit-dataaccess

        \n2. **Identify Datasets as Collections:**\n   - Each separate dataset within\
        \ ODE serves as a \"Collection.\" A Collection in STAC is a group of related\

        \ are individual data entries or assets, which are referred to as \"Items.\"\
        \n\n4. **Access and Features:**\n   - Users can track search history, bookmark\

        \ symbols).\n\nIn summary, to access ODE as a catalog using STAC, each dataset\
        \ is a collection, and individual data entries are items. Python code will\

      output: 'To write Python code to access the Orbital Data Explorer (ODE) using
        STAC terminology, you should understand the following key points from the
        text:


        1. **ODE as a Catalog**: Consider ODE as a catalog that organizes different
        datasets. In STAC terms, a catalog is a container or index of collections.


        2. **Collections**: Each dataset within ODE should be viewed as a collection.
        A collection in STAC is a group of related items, typically containing similar
        types of data.


        3. **Items**: Within each collection, there are items. In STAC, an item is
        an individual data entity or asset with metadata, such as a single image or
        data file.


        4. **Account System**: The text mentions creating an account and signing in.
        This could imply that to access data programmatically, you may potentially
        need authentication. Consider looking into API keys or login credentials if
        necessary.


        5. **Data Access**: The text talks about "Data Product Search," "Map Search,"
        and "Data Set Browser," indicating that ODE supports searching and browsing
        functionalities. These features might be accessible through an API, which
        you''ll need to explore for programmatic access.


        To proceed, you should investigate whether ODE provides a REST API or another
        interface conforming to the STAC (SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog) specification.
        This could involve reviewing ODE''s official documentation or contacting their
        support for further guidance on programmatic data access methods.


        Additionally, familiarize yourself with the basic structure and concepts of
        STAC such as catalogs, collections, items, and how they are accessed via APIs.
        Libraries such as `pystac` might be useful for handling STAC data in Python.'

        \ and outlines the functionality available on its website. To achieve the\
        \ objective of accessing ODE using STAC terminology, key elements to consider\
        \ include:\n\n1. **Catalog**: The Mars Orbital Data Explorer itself can be\
        \ considered a catalog, which serves as the entry point to all the data collections.\n\
        \n2. **Collections**: Each separate dataset in ODE can be seen as a collection.\
        \ These collections are grouped by missions (e.g., Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter,\
        \ 2001 Mars Odyssey, Mars Global Surveyor), instruments, and data sets.\n\n\
        3. **Items**: An Item in STAC terms would correspond to individual data products\
        \ or files within these collections. These can be searched based on parameters\
        \ like time, location, and product IDs.\n\n4. **Functionality for ODE Access**:\n\
        \   - Use the **Data Product Search** to find and filter items across different\
        \ collections using criteria such as time, location, and product IDs.\n  \
        \ - Use the **Data Set Browser** to navigate through available collections\
        \ and their respective items stored in the PDS archives.\n\n5. **Additional\
        \ Features**:\n   - **Download Cart**: Users can add items to a download cart\
        \ for batch downloading.\n   - **Help & Resources**: Provides access to additional\
        \ information and resources, which can be valuable for understanding the datasets\
        \ and how to work with the data.\n\nBy representing ODE with these STAC concepts,\
        \ you can create a hierarchical structure where the catalog contains multiple\
        \ collections, each of which contains items of data, allowing for structured\
        \ and efficient access to the data available in ODE."

        \ catalog, which you will be interacting with in your Python code.\n\n2. **Datasets\
        \ as Collections**:\n   - Collection: Each dataset within ODE functions as\
        \ a separate STAC collection. Collections contain metadata common to all the\
        \ items in the dataset, such as the dataset's name, description, and spatial\
        \ and temporal extent.\n\n3. **Data Products as Items**:\n   - Item: In STAC,\
        \ an item represents an individual, identifiable asset. In the context of\
        \ ODE, these would correspond to individual data products within a dataset.\
        \ Each item will have specific metadata attributes like acquisition time,\
        \ location, product ID, etc.\n\n4. **Elements to Access**:\n   - Data Product\
        \ Search: This feature is likely used to navigate or query items within a\
        \ collection (dataset).\n   - Data Set Browser: This may allow browsing through\
        \ available collections (datasets).\n\n5. **Implementation Steps**:\n   -\
        \ Authenticate: Consider whether authentication is required; if so, implement\
        \ a mechanism to manage user authentication.\n   - Query: Use a STAC Client\
        \ library or HTTP methods to interact with the ODE system and query the required\
        \ collections or items.\n   - Parse Results: Parse the returned datasets and\
        \ items according to STAC JSON structure.\n   - Download: Use the \"Download\"\
        \ functionality mentioned to retrieve specific data items.\n\n6. **Additional\
        \ Resources**:\n   - Utilize available \"Help & Resources\" to understand\
        \ ODE's API endpoints or data retrieval methods better.\n   - Consider using\
        \ the \"Tools\" or \"Map Search\" for enhanced data interaction if applicable.\n\
        \nBy structuring your Python code around these STAC elements, you'll be able\
        \ to effectively access and retrieve data from ODE, treating it as a catalog\
