      Our objective is to write Python code to access the Orbital Data Explorer, ODE for short,
      using STAC terminology. For this purpose, we consider ODE as a catalog and each separate
      dataset in ODE as a collection that contains items.

      output: "To download data from the Orbital Data Explorer (ODE) using STAC terminology\
        \ via Python, you need to focus on accessing and retrieving data. While the\
        \ provided text is largely about signing into the ODE system, it doesn't contain\
        \ specific STAC-related information or API endpoints directly associated with\
        \ data retrieval.\n\nHowever, here\u2019s a general approach based on standard\
        \ practices for accessing datasets using STAC and APIs:\n\n1. **Authentication:**\
        \ First, authenticate the user using the login information. The text provides\
        \ instructions on signing into the ODE:\n\n    ```python\n    import requests\n\
        \n    # Assuming ODE provides an API for authentication\n    login_url = \"\
        https://ode-website.com/api/login\"  # Replace this with the actual URL\n\
        \    \n    payload = {\n        'email': 'your_email@example.com',\n     \
        \   'password': 'your_password'\n    }\n    \n    session = requests.Session()\n\
        \    response = session.post(login_url, data=payload)\n    \n    if response.ok:\n\
        \        print(\"Successfully signed in!\")\n    else:\n        print(\"Sign\
        \ in failed!\")\n    ```\n\n2. **Access STAC API:** Once signed in, navigate\
        \ to the STAC API endpoint for ODE to search and download data. You might\
        \ need to use specific URLs or endpoints that relate to STAC item searches.\n\
        \n    ```python\n    stac_search_url = \"https://ode-website.com/api/stac/search\"\
        \  # Replace this with the actual STAC search endpoint\n\n    # A generic\
        \ STAC search payload\n    headers = {\n        'Content-Type': 'application/json'\n\
        \    }\n    \n    search_payload = {\n        \"collections\": [\"collection-id\"\
        ],\n        \"bbox\": [-180.0, -90.0, 180.0, 90.0],\n        \"datetime\"\
        : \"2022-01-01T00:00:00Z/2023-01-01T00:00:00Z\",\n        \"limit\": 10\n\
        \    }\n    \n    search_response = session.post(stac_search_url, headers=headers,\
        \ json=search_payload)\n    \n    if search_response.ok:\n        items =\
        \ search_response.json()\n        print(\"Retrieved STAC items:\", items)\n\
        \    else:\n        print(\"Failed to retrieve items!\")\n    ```\n\n3. **Downloading\
        \ Data:** Iterate over the results and download the needed data assets:\n\n\
        \    ```python\n    for item in items.get('features', []):\n        for asset_key,\
        \ asset in item['assets'].items():\n            download_url = asset['href']\n\
        \            print(f\"Downloading asset from {download_url}\")\n         \
        \   asset_response = session.get(download_url)\n            \n           \
        \ if asset_response.ok:\n                with open(f\"assets/{asset_key}.dat\"\
        , 'wb') as f:\n                    f.write(asset_response.content)\n     \
        \           print(f\"Downloaded {asset_key} successfully!\")\n           \
        \ else:\n                print(f\"Failed to download {asset_key}\")\n    ```\n\
        \nPlease note that the actual API endpoints, collections, and authentication\
        \ mechanisms must be replaced with the real URLs and parameters used by the\
        \ ODE system. Always refer to the official ODE documentation for correct details."

        Submit Search Sign In Signing into ODE with a user account is simple. Click
        on the user icon, which will show as not signed in. It will display the following
        menu, which contains the sign in option. Click on the "Sign in" link. This
        displays the log in page. Enter your email address and password. Then click
        the "Sign in" button. After successful log in, a confirmation message will

      output: "To achieve the objective of downloading data from the Orbital Data\
        \ Explorer (ODE) using STAC (SpatioTemporal Asset Catalog) terminology, the\
        \ following steps and considerations are relevant:\n\n1. **Logging In**: \n\
        \   - Users need to sign into ODE to access features such as bookmarks, history,\
        \ and cart orders, which are used to organize and retrieve data.\n   - Once\
        \ signed in, users can utilize the dropdown menu in the website banner to\
        \ navigate different sections of the ODE.\n\n2. **Accessing Data for Different\
        \ Targets**:\n   - ODE provides access to data for different planetary targets,\
        \ including Mars, Mercury, Lunar, and Venus. \n   - Users can switch between\
        \ these targets using a dropdown menu, which allows navigation to different\
        \ versions of the ODE website corresponding to each target.\n\n3. **STAC Terminology\
        \ Utilization**:\n   - Use the navigational elements provided (Bookmarks,\
        \ History, and Cart Orders) to organize and retrieve data in a way that aligns\
        \ with STAC practices. STAC typically involves organizing data as collections,\
        \ items with metadata, and assets that can be accessed or downloaded.\n\n\
        4. **Navigational Features**:\n   - Utilize the navigational menu on the left\
        \ side of the page to select specific actions like viewing Bookmarks, History,\
        \ and Cart Orders.\n   - These features might be used to manage datasets and\
        \ download relevant data, similar to using STAC catalogs, collections, and\
        \ assets.\n\n5. **Data Retrieval**:\n   - Follow the links provided in the\
        \ user interface to access lists of bookmarks, history, and cart orders. These\
        \ lists are essential for managing and retrieving data efficiently.\n   -\
        \ Extract data using these organizational tools, potentially by automated\
        \ scripts written in Python to interact with these elements via web requests\
        \ if APIs are available.\n\nIn summary, understanding and leveraging the account,\
        \ navigational features, and organization of data (using Bookmarks, History,\
        \ Cart Orders) in ODE will facilitate downloading data adhering to STAC terminology\
        \ and practices. If APIs are available, you can automate interactions and\
        \ data management using Python."
